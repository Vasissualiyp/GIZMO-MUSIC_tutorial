# Setting up MUSIC

Once you loaded all the necessary modules on your machine, here are the 
steps that you have to undergo if you want to run MUSIC:
1. Git clone relevant MUSIC repo
2. Compile the code, and make sure that the binary was created
3. Setup the run parameters
4. Create a submission script
5. Submit the job to your cluster (if working on a cluster) or run the executable (if running directly on the node)
6. Track your job to see if there are any errors appearing.
